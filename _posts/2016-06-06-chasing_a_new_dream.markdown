*(The following title and copy is a paste from my personal blog. I started that blog on 6/20/2015 - the day after I quit my job because I wanted to focus on learning to code full time)
*

I can't recall exactly when I decided I was the wrong fit for Procirc. I remember my first meeting with SM as far as "training" goes and it went very uncomfortably for me.  As was the norm with her during my entire year there, and even up to my final day at the office, I would often sit in silence while she rummaged through files on her pc or through papers at her desk or file cabinets; looking for data or information to share with me.  As I sat waiting patiently in that first meeting, she said that she "didn't want to waste my time."  Looking back on my nearly one year of working at this company, I certainly feel that as a whole, I indeed wasted a year of my professional career.

I was eager to work again after 4 months of unemployment but my fit was wrong in every capacity.  I accomplished alot at Time Inc. but my disinterest in the type of work we did at Procirc took hold immediately. I've found in job interviews that I do not make it to the final rounds at interesting companies because I lack digital experience. I am not the right fit.  Procirc work is anything but digital but I gave it a shot and while things got done and the wheels kept turning, I had a lack of trust from upper management and especially from our overbearing CFO.  Everything was scrutinized and most everything that came from me needed to be approved first or if it was something I could clearly handle, it was still criticized.  Add to it the slow process of getting work done by different teams, the times I was thrown under the bus, the neutering of me in day-to-day work or client relations and the obvious dissatisfaction with the learning curve I had to endure; I became the worst version of my professional self. Lazy. Disinterested. Miserable.  The job was a raise in salary but the experience was nothing short of the worst professional experience of my life.

I was very depressed by 2015 but somewhere on the news I saw a story about web development academys. Not much time later, I got aquainted with web development courses online and I began to spend my free time learning in the hopes of escaping my nightmare.

Soon enough web academys came into my focus again and I practiced coding and programming for the very first time.  It was hard but I loved it. It was new and it felt important. Sometime then I decided this would be my professional purpose.  Winter 2014/2015 was harsh and in those days of staying home, I spent hours and hours preparing, in the hopes of escaping this job and getting into the next available group.  I gave myself four weeks and soon realized how incredibly unprepared I was!

Fast forward through March-Today, I've spent time with programming as I always have but I let my life and my distractions get in the way of getting to the next step. All the while, I tried to balance applying for new work and coding practice in the same days but it just didn't feel like enough time.  The poisonous job environment took up 8 hours of my day and I didn't feel there was enough hours in the evening to handle the amount of learning i truly needed to do to pass the entry barriers of boot camp.

So two weeks ago I gave my notice - I finally got fed up with Procirc. I was tired of wasting away on projects I didn't care about for people that were not invested in giving me a chance to succeed. As of yesterday i'm free from this job - I have no income coming but I've saved my sanity. This move was 100% right for my happiness but now comes the true test. The test of my resolve to see this new dream of mines through to the end.

I've started this journal for myself in an attempt to stay accountable and track my progress.  Starting Monday, I only report to myself. It took a place as miserable and old fashioned as Procirc to motivate me into doing this and I know I can do this - I haven't failed myself when I really want something and I hope this time will be no different.
