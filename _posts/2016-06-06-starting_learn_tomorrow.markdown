(lifted from my personal blog 4/23/2016)

8:21am - What more can be said, tomorrow is a big day for me.  I remember finding Learn that day at starbucks when I decided to study outside of the house. It might have been something as simple as a facebook ad but that pre curriculum from Learn promised that I would make tic-tac-toe and sure enough, I was able to do it step by step, piece by piece.  I remember feeling pretty proud about it because it felt redeeming after the a/A failures.  To do this day I still struggle to handle the a/A version of tic-tac-toe but at least all these months later, I can make sense of most of that work and I feel much more secure in my coding than ever.  

The Learn program makes no assumptions on how smart I am and it appears the work will be taken slowly and steadily, without throwing me into the flames as quickly as a/A felt.  That is exciting for me and I absolutely believe I am ready and in a place to see this through.  I think now when I need to ask questions and for help, its not going to be a question of how to mix the cement. I believe my foundation is solid now and that the TA's are going to be in a position to help move past the tricky stuff.

In my mind, I feel the process of working through Learn would be a great benefit in my current job and allow for some opportunity to open up there. Anyways I'm gonna get ready for the gym this morning and maybe i'll study a little bit as a refresher.  I start the new journey tomorrow and i'm very excited.
